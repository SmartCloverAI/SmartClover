title: "Deploying with a 'your AI, your Data' Edge Platform"

excerpt: "How SmartClover ships Next.js services to on-prem and on-edge infrastructure with ledger-backed CI/CD."
---

Our "your AI, your Data" edge platform turns Git repositories into running applications without bespoke DevOps scripts. The service clones your repo, installs dependencies, builds the project, and launches it across a blockchain-governed network of edge nodes that you control. Continuous delivery hooks straight into the decentralised control plane, so regulated teams manage deployments with the same ergonomics as a hosted platform.
</br></br>
For SmartClover, that means our healthcare analytics portals and cybersecurity dashboards run close to the users who need them, with reliability that comes from decentralisation rather than a single region. Updates are as simple as pushing new code and triggering the pipeline—the platform handles container orchestration, tunnels, observability, and immutable ledger attestations.
</br></br>
To make that possible, SmartClover brings regulated-sector requirements for auditable AI workloads while the platform provides a hardened edge network with per-tenant isolation and programmable data residency. Shared sprints cover everything from privacy-preserving build pipelines to deterministic rollbacks, so every deployment satisfies healthcare compliance without slowing our shipping cadence.
</br></br>
This deployment model aligns with our values: keep control with the creators, protect sensitive data, and ensure critical services stay online even if one node fails. We are co-developing governance tooling to expose cryptographic attestations and consent-aware routing directly inside our clinician dashboards. It is the infrastructure foundation for our next generation of human-centred AI experiences.
