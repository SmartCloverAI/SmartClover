title: "What CerviGuard Proposes: Clinical AI Built on Remote Screening Experience"
date: "2025-11-03"
excerpt: "CerviGuard combines secure clinical workflows with AI-assisted triage, grounded in lessons from remote-area prophylaxis and cervical screening research missions."

CerviGuard is SmartClover's flagship healthcare AI project for cervical cancer prevention and follow-up. The proposal is practical: provide clinicians with a secure workspace where AI can support case triage and workflow management, while medical teams remain in final control of decisions.

## What the project proposes in operational terms

CerviGuard proposes a clinical operating model where de-identified cervical image intake, AI-assisted interpretation, and role-based follow-up are connected in one audit-ready workflow. Instead of fragmented files and ad-hoc communication, teams can use one traceable path from intake to follow-up planning.

The objective is not to replace clinical judgment. The objective is to reduce missed follow-up signals, improve consistency in triage support, and keep evidence visible at decision points so clinicians can act faster and with better context.

## Why this is tied to remote-area prophylaxis and screening missions

This project is based on experience from Romanian remote-area prophylaxis and cervical screening missions, where field teams documented real barriers to participation and follow-up. Those barriers are not abstract; they include access gaps, trust issues, communication friction, and delayed care pathways.

The same problem patterns are documented in peer-reviewed studies that inform the product direction:

1. [PubMed 28460211](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28460211/)
   Qualitative research on Roma women's participation in cervical cancer screening in Romania (Social Science & Medicine, 2017), including co-authorship by Dr. Florian Nicula and Andreea Itu (publication name used earlier by Dr. Andreea Damian).
2. [PubMed 35197342](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35197342/)
   BMJ Open protocol on facilitators and barriers to follow-up after abnormal cervical screening in remote Romanian communities (2022), co-authored by Dr. Andreea Damian.

These studies help define where a digital clinical workflow has the highest impact: continuity of follow-up, transparent review steps, and stronger coordination between clinical and operational actors.

## Current direction

CerviGuard is being developed as a secure, human-in-the-loop clinical system where technology supports teams that already carry responsibility for patient pathways. The proposal is to turn field-informed screening and follow-up lessons into daily operational capability, not just research output.
