## 1) Purpose

## 3) Device Identification
- Device/trade name: CerviGuard
- Device type: Software as a medical companion application (web platform)
- Current product form:
  - January 2020: first pilot as downloadable Win32 TensorFlow-based app (pre-launch of SMARTCLOVER SRL)
  - May 2025: online CerviGuard system launched
- Model/version identifier: CerviGuard v0.4.7 (retrieved from live login page footer on 2026-02-17)
- Basic UDI-DI: MISSING INPUT
- UDI-DI/UDI-PI: MISSING INPUT (or state not applicable if justified by regulatory owner)
- Intended market: EU and Romania
- First placing on the market date:
  - Downloadable pilot: January 2020
  - Online system: May 2025

## 4) Intended Purpose and User Profile
- Intended purpose:
  CerviGuard is positioned as a cervical cancer screening companion application that supports structured case intake, AI-assisted analysis, triage, and follow-up coordination, with clinicians retaining final decision authority.
- Target users:
  Authorized clinicians and authorized healthcare operations personnel.
- Target population/context:
  Individuals in cervical screening and follow-up pathways, including gynecological oncological prophylaxis management workflows.
- Core operational functions:
  - Secure role-based access
  - De-identified image/case intake
  - AI-assisted transformation-zone and lesion classification support
  - Case tracking and follow-up workflow support
  - CAEN context of manufacturer activity: 6201 - software development at customer request (corporate activity classification, not medical classification)
- Contraindications/limitations (draft IFU text):
  - Not intended for autonomous diagnosis or autonomous therapeutic decision-making.
  - Not intended to replace specialist clinical judgment, colposcopic examination, histopathology, or established national screening protocols.
  - Not intended for patient self-use or unsupervised operation by non-clinical users.
  - Outputs are decision-support indicators and must be interpreted by qualified clinicians in context with complete patient information.
  - Performance may be degraded with low-quality images, incomplete case metadata, or non-standard acquisition workflows.
  - Use is limited to authorized accounts and configured environments with data governance controls in place.
- Human oversight statement:
  CerviGuard is a companion support tool and not an autonomous decision-maker; final clinical judgment remains with qualified professionals.

## 5) Classification Statement (MDR)
- Proposed class (manufacturer positioning): Class I
- Is device sterile: No (confirmation required from regulatory owner)
- Has measuring function: No
- Reusable surgical instrument: No
- Classification rule(s) applied (Annex VIII): Rule 11 (software), draft mapping to the "all other software" branch (Class I) subject to legal/regulatory confirmation
- Classification rationale summary:
  Draft legal rationale: CerviGuard is intended as a clinical companion workflow tool that structures case intake, supports triage prioritization, and provides non-binding AI-assisted signals under mandatory clinician oversight. It is not intended to independently establish diagnosis, select therapy, or trigger autonomous clinical action. Under this intended-use framing, classification is proposed under Rule 11 as Class I ("all other software"), with explicit reclassification trigger if future intended use expands toward direct diagnostic/therapeutic decision-driving functionality.
