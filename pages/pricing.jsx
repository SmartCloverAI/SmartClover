      <h1>Commercial structure for SmartClover healthcare SaaS/PaaS products</h1>
      <p>
        SmartClover operates a quote-based B2B model. Packages define delivery boundaries, onboarding scope, and
        operating responsibilities before any commercial commitment is issued.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section className="surface-card" aria-labelledby="pricing-model-heading">

        <h2 id="pricing-model-heading">Commercial model summary</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        All commercial fees are provided exclusively through a formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) process after scope
        definition. This includes subscription, onboarding, integration, and optional module fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        SmartClover does not publish numeric list prices. Formal quotations are issued after qualifying scope, deployment
        mode, governance requirements, and contractual boundaries.
