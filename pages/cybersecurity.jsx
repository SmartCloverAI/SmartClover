      <h1>AI-enhanced defence for patient data and clinical systems</h1>
      <p>
        The healthcare sector is a prime target for cyber attacks. We use AI to strengthen defences, reduce noise, and
        keep clinicians focused on patient care.

      <h2>Why healthcare needs adaptive security</h2>
      <p>
        Sensitive patient data, connected medical devices, and critical infrastructure make hospitals uniquely valuable
        to attackers. Industry reports place the average cost of a healthcare breach around $10.9M, underscoring the need
        for resilient security investments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditional monitoring floods teams with false alarms. Our AI-assisted sensors learn normal behaviour, surface
        anomalies that matter, and shorten the time to respond.

      <h2>What we deliver</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Machine learning models for anomaly detection across clinical networks and IoT devices.</li>
        <li>Continuous risk scoring that prioritises investigations for SOC engineers.</li>
        <li>Privacy-first data pipelines aligned with patient safety regulations.</li>
        <li>Operational playbooks that keep humans in charge of decision making.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        AI does not replace cybersecurity experts-it equips them with sharper, more contextualised intelligence so they
        can protect patients and staff.
